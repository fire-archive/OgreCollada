A short how to build this project under windows
- download boost from boost.org (tested with 1.35.0)
- set environment variable BOOST_ROOT
- check out OpenCOLLADA from SVN  (https://opencollada.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opencollada/trunk)
- set environment variable OPENCOLLADA_HOME
- build libxml in the OpenCOLLADA source tree (by using %OPENCOLLADA_HOME%\Externals\LibXML\scripts\LibXML.vcproj)
- download and install OGRE SDK (this will set OGRE_HOME)
- run scripts/premake/build_vs<your version>.bat
    this will generate vcproj files in scripts/premake/ and a sln file in build/vs<your version>/
- open the sln file
- set target to DebugStatic (the only target that has been tested)
- build OgreColladaConverter (OgreCOLLADAViewer is currently not supported)
- the binary will be moved to tools/bin you may launch it from there
